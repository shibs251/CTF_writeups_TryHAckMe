This was an extremely simple ctf.

I imediately opened the Ip address in the browser as instructed by the room. This brough me to a simple login page.  
There was no way to register an account but underneath the login button was a statement which read

Don't have an account? Use the guest account! (Ctrl+U)

Typing in ctrl + u opened up the page source.
At the bottom was a comment which read 


<!-- use guest:guest credentials until registration is fixed. "admin" user account is off limits!!!!! -->

So I attempted to login in using 'guest' as both the username and password, it worked.

This brought me to a page with the following screen

Hi, guest. Welcome to our site. Try not to peep your neighbor's profile.

Looking in the browser I could see 

/profile.php?user=guest

So I changed guest to neighbor, and it worked.  The onscreen text was changed to 

Hi, neighbor. Welcome to our site. Try not to peep your neighbor's profile.

I then changed /profile.php?user=neighbor in the browser to read /profile.php?user=admin, and was taken to a page with the flag

Hi, admin. Welcome to your site. The flag is: flag{66be95c478473d91a5358f2440c7af1f}
